<p> 

<b>
<font face="ALGERIAN" color="blue" size="+2">H</font>ey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself.
Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so
well that you do not know where to start with.  Let me give a try to see
what kind of image you have about me through my self-description.  I hope
that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so
different.  Here it goes....
</b>
<p>
<b>
<font face="arial" color="red" size="+2">I</font> am a person who is positive about every aspect of life.  There are many
things I like to do, to see, and to experience.  I like to read and
write codes;  I like meeting new friends; I like to associate with people, I like sharing of ideas. I like to feel the music flowing on my face.I like to sleep late, I like to get up early;
I hate to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people; I like motivational books and  movies.
 </b>
</p>

<p>
<b>
<font face="arial" color="violet" size="+2">I</font> always wanted to be a great writer, like mark zuckerberg who developed facebook, or like bill gates the co-founder of microsoft.  They have
influenced millions of people through their books.  I also wanted to be a
great psychologist, like William James or Sigmund Freud, who could read
people’s mind.  Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet.  I am
just someone who does some teaching, some research, and some writing.  But
my dream is still alive.
